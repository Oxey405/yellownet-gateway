        <h2>About YELOWNET</h2>
        <p>
          YELLOWNET is a networking protocol made for the
          <a href="https://play.date">Playdate</a> by
          <a href="https://oxey405.com">Oxey405</a>! <br />
          It works using WebSerial which allows webpages to communicate with
          physical devices. YELLOWNET is a standard of communication that<br>
          enables the Playdate to communicate with servers around the world by
          using a <b>Gateway</b> <i>(like this one)</i> to forward packets both ways.
        </p>
        <h2>Why not use the Playdate's Wi-Fi chip ?</h2>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, the Playdate doesn't just let you have fun with the network as it's considered something sensitive.<br>
          Although some games can access online leaderboards and the system has online features, games not published on <i>Catalog</i> cannot access Wi-Fi<span>*</span>.
          That's why such a complex system is required for YELLOWNET to... well.. work!<br>
          <span class="note">* Well you <i>can</i> try and write your own C Networking API implementation for the ESP32 by reverse engineering stuff <br><b>BUT</b> note that it's going to be way though and this would probably make Panic mad and we don't want to piss off Panic ♥️</span>
        </p>
        <h2>Is this Open-Source ? Can I contribute ?</h2>
        <p>
          Off course the project is open-source ! And if you have medium experience with modern Javascript and Lua you can contribute for sure!<br>
          Every part of this system is Open-source ; the client and server libraries as well as the gateway that you can self-host by the way !
